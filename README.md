# Unsupervised-Learning-Clustering-Techniques-on-Iris-Dataset
The objective of this project is to evaluate the understanding and application of clustering techniques using the popular Iris dataset. In this project, We will implement and analyze two clustering algorithms: KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a famous dataset that consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with five features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species. For this project, We will be using the version available in the sklearn library.

## Contents
* Load the Iris dataset using the sklearn.datasets module.
* Drop the "species" column since this is a clustering problem (unsupervised learning), and we don't need the labels.
  #### Clustering Algorithm Implementation
  * KMeans Clustering
  * Hierarchical Clustering
  * How it works.
  * Why it might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
  * Apply KMeans and Hierarchical clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualize the clusters.
